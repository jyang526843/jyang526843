### Hi there 👋 I'm Jin Yang! 😄

- I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics at UT-Austin!
- I earned my PhD degree from Caltech ME under the supervision of Prof. [Kaushik Bhattacharya](https://mechmat.caltech.edu/). I was a postdoc working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison ME department (Postdoc advisor: Prof. [Christian Franck](https://www.franck.engr.wisc.edu/) )
- My research areas include solid mechanics, experimental mechanics, digital image/volume correlation, laser induced inertial cavitation in soft matter (material's behavior at ultra-high strain rates).
- We develop and maintain several open source libraries and solvers, more on that here!  🖥️ 
- If you want to work with us, check out [my personal website](https://sites.utexas.edu/yang/)!  📫 
- Feel free to [reach out](mailto:jin.yang@austin.utexas.edu) to me if you have any cool ideas!
